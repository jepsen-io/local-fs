# jepsen.local-fs

Jepsen tests for local filesystems. Unlike most Jepsen tests, this runs purely
on your local node; no cluster required.

This works by [generating random histories of filesystem
operations](src/jepsen/local_fs/shell/workload.clj), [applying them to a real
filesystem](src/jepsen/local_fs/shell/client.clj), and then checking to see
whether the filesystem behaved like [a simulated, purely-functional
model](src/jepsen/local_fs/shell/checker.clj). When it finds a bug, it uses
Clojure's [test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check) to automatically
shrink the history to a minimal failing example.

That example includes a trace of the operations performed, shows you what state
it thought the filesystem was in, what it expected to perform, and what the
filesystem actually did. For instance, here's a bug we found in lazyfs where
fsyncing a file, losing un-fsynced writes, then extending (via `truncate`) that
file caused the file's contents to be replaced with zeroes:

```clj
[:ok :append [["a"] "01"]]
[:ok :fsync ["a"]]
[:ok :read [["a"] "01"]]
[:ok :lose-unfsynced-writes nil]
[:ok :read [["a"] "01"]]
[:ok :truncate [["a"] 1]]
[:ok :read [["a"] "0000"]]

At this point, the fs was theoretically
{:next-inode-number 1,
 :cache {:inodes {0 {:link-count 1, :data "0100"}}, :entries {}},
 :disk
 {:inodes {0 {:link-count 1, :data "01"}},
  :entries {[] {:type :dir}, ["a"] {:type :link, :inode 0}}}}

And we expected to execute
{:process 0,
 :f :read,
 :value [["a"] "0100"],
 :time 55473430,
 :type :ok,
 :index 13}

But with our filesystem we actually executed
{:process 0,
 :f :read,
 :value [["a"] "0000"],
 :time 55473430,
 :type :ok,
 :index 13}
```

Like all Jepsen tests, you'll find results, logs, and performance charts for
each test run in `store/`.

This is, unfortunately, a single-threaded test. I have *no* idea how to go
about modeling & checking POSIX filesystem safety under concurrent operations.
That said, single-threaded testing has been remarkably productive during lazyfs
development, so this might be useful for you too!

## Quickcheck

To check the local filesystem (using a directory called `data` in this repository):

```
lein run quickcheck
```

This automatically generates histories of operations, applies them to the
filesystem, and checks that they look OK. If it finds a bug, it'll try to
shrink that history to a minimal failing case.

To find a bug in lazyfs, run:

```
lein run quickcheck --db lazyfs --version 5d45bf8b792a1e782000e512229ec755a64c85f4 --lose-unfsynced-writes
```

To do this you'll need libfuse3-dev, fuse set up appropriately for lazyfs, gcc,
etc, as well as leiningen. This will run a whole bunch of tests and spit out
results in `store/`. You can browse these at the filesystem directly, or run

When you have a failing case, you might want to dive into it deeper. You can
replay a test like so:

```
lein run quickcheck --db lazyfs ... --history store/some-test/some-time/history.edn
```

This will retry the same operations from that EDN file. It'll go on to
aggressively shrink this history to a subset of operations, though it won't
shrink operations themselves. This might be a more efficient search than just
waiting for the initial `lein run quickcheck` to do its thing.

## Options

Use `--help` for a full list of options.

## Dealing with Nondeterminism

Some bugs can only be reproduced *sometimes*, but you want to shrink them
regardless. Try `lein run quickcheck --history foo.edn --quickcheck-scour 100
...` to run up to 100 trials of any given history before declaring it
valid/invalid. This will be agonizingly slow, but will stop the search from
terminating early with a super-long example.

## Concurrent Tests

These will *definitely* not work correctly as far as safety testing is
concerned, but they might be neat from a crash-safety or performance
perspective. Try

```
lein run test --concurrency 10 --time-limit 30
```

This will run 10 IO threads which concurrently perform random operations. The
checker assumes histories are singlethreaded and will probably complain in
confusing ways. Pay it no mind.

## Browsing Results

Run

```
lein run serve
```

... which launches a web server on http://localhost:8080, serving up the contents of `store/`.
